# Welcome to Code Words Game

## Inspiration

This is my take on the popular game, Code Words. I played it every week online with my family during the months of quarantine in 2020. We would play on the website [http://codewordsgame.com](http://codewordsgame.com), which serves as the initial inspiration for this project. However, I came across frustrating issues on that version where my timer was often incorrect leading to me missing the deadline for my code. I decided it would be worthwhile to create a similar version of the game with my own personal take. 

I started my project by following a [tutorial](https://medium.com/better-programming/building-a-chat-application-from-scratch-with-room-functionality-df3d1e4ef662) to build a chat app:

## Technologies Used

The backend is written in **Javascript** and **Node.js**. In addition, I used the **Express** framework to build the web application along with **body-parser** for the middleware and **Socket.io** to communicate between server and browser. I used the **EJS** template to build HTML and **Bootstrap** to design the frontend.

## Usage

Just clone the repository and run `node install` and then `node app.js` in the terminal.
