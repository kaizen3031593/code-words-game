# Welcome to Code Words Game

## Inspiration

This is my take on the popular game, Code Words. I played it every week online with my family during the months of quarantine in 2020. We would play on the website [http://codewordsgame.com](http://codewordsgame.com), which serves as the initial inspiration for this project. However, I came across frustrating issues on that version where my timer was often incorrect leading to me missing the deadline for my code. I decided it would be worthwhile to create a similar version of the game with my own personal take.
